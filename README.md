# Machine Learning-Based Algorithm to Project Outcomes of MLB At-Bats

Project with Peter Bigica for MAT 332: Applied Linear Algebra and Machine Learning at Western Connecticut State University, taught by Dr. Xiaodi Wang.

We use a multiclass logistic regression algorithm to generate a Markov matrix to describe potential states of an at-bat between an arbitrarily chosen pitcher and hitter in Major League baseball, then compute predicted outcome probabilities and statistics.

Python libraries used: numpy, pandas, pybaseball, scikit-learn.
